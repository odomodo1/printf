0x10. C - printf

Description

This team project is part of the first year curriculum of ALX Software Egineering School. _printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:

How to use git in a team setting Applying variadic functions to a big project The complexities of printf Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

Prototype
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

Usage
Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters
Examples
_printf("Hello, main\n") prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line
_printf("%s", "Hello") prints "Hello"
_printf("This is a number: %d", 98) prints "This is a number: 98"
File Functions
I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life Write a function that produces output according to format. c : converts input into a character s : converts input into a string

Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't

Handle the following conversion specifiers: d : converts input into a base 10 integer i : converts input into an integer

Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel

Create a man page for your function

With a face like mine, I do better in print

Handle the following conversion specifiers: b : the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print

Handle the following conversion specifiers: u : converts the input into an unsigned integer o : converts the input into an octal number x : converts the input into a hexadecimal number X : converts the input into a hexadecimal number with capital letters

Nothing in fine print is ever good news

Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

My weakness is wearing too much leopard print

Handle the following custom conversion specifier: S : prints the string

 Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print

Handle the following conversion specifier: p : int input is converted to a pointer address

The big print gives and the small print takes away

Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers: + : adds a + in front of signed positive numbers and a - in front of signed negative numbers space : same as +, but adds a space (is overwritten by +) # : adds a 0 in front of octal conversions that don't begin with one, and a 0x or 0X for x or X conversions

Sarcasm is lost in print

Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: l : converts d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in short signed or unsigned ints h : converts d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in long signed or unsigned ints

Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests

Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance

Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print

Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection

Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party

Handle the following custom conversion specifier: r : prints the reversed string

The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring

Handle the following custom conversion specifier: R : prints the rot13'ed string

All the above options work well together.
